//* SERIALISATION 

// the process of converting data from one form to other form so that it can be transfered/stored convienently
// usually, Json objects, arrays, numbers, bool, etc are converted into strings 
// for being transfered/Stored into Database(for example localhost storage api)

// converting functions into string is not possible, so, function based objects are un-serialisable
