/**
 * //? Why use stack? 
 * //* whenever use stack.top() first check is it not empty by stack.size()>0
 * //* OR use vector, a variable will be needed to mantain the top position
 * //* OR use list, but then pointer will be needed to access the elements, also take care while iterating over the list with pointer iterator.
